    <h2>What is the Keto diet?</h2>
    <p>The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet.
    This leads to the body producing ketones in the liver to be used as energy rather than glucose.
    Typically when you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose.
    When your body needs energy, it will convert glucose into energy.
    Your body will continue to use glucose as its primary energy source since it is so readily available.
    This leads to fat being stored rather than burned for energy.
    The keto diet lowers the intake of carbs, which puts the body into a state known as ketosis.
    Being on a keto diet makes it easier to access stored fat to burn it off.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is ketosis?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ketosis</strong> is when your body starts to break down fat instead of carbohydrates for your primary source of energy.
    When lowering the glucose available, the body will look for an alternative source of fuel(fat).
    When the body starts this process, it will start to produce ketones.
    Ketones are used as an alternative source of energy.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps to achieve Ketosis:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Lower intake of carbohydrates.</strong> Everyone is different.
        When you start the keto diet, your carb limit may be higher while you're transitioning but remember this number can change over time.
        Most sites suggest the limit to be 35 grams of total carbs and 25 grams of net carbs.
        (Net carbs are calculated by subtracting the fiber grams from the total grams of carbs.)</li>
        <li><strong>Restrict protein intake.</strong> Protein should be limited when trying to reach ketosis.
        Excess protein is converted into glucose, leading to low levels of ketosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase fat intake.</strong> Eating more fat will keep you full longer.
        Fat is the main source of energy on keto.
        By consuming more fat, there will be less snack breaks becuase you will be satisifed.</li>
        <li><strong>Drink water.</strong> This may be obvious for any diet change but it is still important to stay hydrated.
        Drinking plenty of water will also help with controlling hunger as well.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>How to know you're in Ketosis?</h3>
    <p>There are different ways to see if you're in ketosis.
    You can measure your ketones level via urine strips but it can be expensive.
    Instead, you can monitor some changes that let you know you're on the right track.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased urination.</strong> Acetoacetate, a ketone body, will lead to increased bathroom visits.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Mouth.</strong> The increased urination will lead to increased thirst and dry mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Bad Breath.</strong> Acetone, a ketone body, excetes in our breath. It smells similar to nail polish remover and is temporary.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced hunger and increased energy.</strong> Increased fat intake leads to feeling satified longer.
        After getting over the "keto flu", many people expierence higher energy levels.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Fat Burner vs Sugar Burner</h2>
    <p>When you eat something that is high in carbs, your body produces glucose and insulin.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Glucose</strong> is the easiest molecule for your body to convert and use as energy so that is why it's the preferred energy source for your body.</li>
      <li><strong>Insulin</strong> is produced to process the glucose in your bloodstream by transporting it around your body.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The problem with this is that when glucose is used as a primary energy source, fats are not needed for energy and therefore are stored.
    Because your body uses glucose as it's main energy source the glucose that is converted into fat doesn't get used.
    When your body runs out of glucose it tells your brain you need more which leads to you reaching for a quick snack like a candy bar or chips rather than just burning the fat that you have stored.</p>
    <p>So what needs to be done...</p>
    <p><strong>Become a fat burner instead of a sugar burner.</strong></p>

    <h2>Benefits of Keto Diet</h2>
    <p>There are many different benefits that come along with being on this keto diet. Below, you'll find a short list of those benefits.</p>
    <h3>Weight Loss</h3>
    <p>The ketogenic diet makes your body start to use fat as energy rather than carbs, so its obvious you'll lose some weight.
    The idea behind eating more fat and reducing carb intake, it makes you feel less hungry compared to other diets.
    The longer you are integrated into the diet, you become a fat-burning machine!</p>
    <h3>Controls Blood Sugar and helps with other conditions</h3>
    <p>Keto naturally lowers blood sugar because of the food you eat and the decrease in glucose intake.
    Keto has been shown to have huge benefits for people that are pre-diabetic or have Type II diabetes.
    **If you’re pre-diabetic or have Type II diabetes, you should seriously consider a ketogenic diet.</p>
    <h4>It has even been found to be better than other diets at helping people with:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Epilepsy</li>
      <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
      <li>Alzheimer’s disease</li>
      <li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
      <li>Chronic Inflammation</li>
      <li>High Blood Sugar Levels</li>
      <li>Obesity</li>
      <li>Heart Disease</li>
      <li>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</li>
      <li>Fatty Liver Disease</li>
      <li>Cancer</li>
      <li>Migraines</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mental Focus</h3>
    <p>Ketones are a great source of fuel for the brain.
    When you lower carb intake, you avoid big spikes in blood sugar.
    Together, this can result in improved focus and concentration.
    Many people partake in keto simply to help mental performance</p>
    <h3>Increased Energy & Normalized Hunger</h3>
    <p>By giving your body a better and more reliable energy source, you will feel more energized during the day.
    Fats are shown to be the most effective molecule to burn as fuel.
    On top of that, fat is naturally more satisfying and ends up leaving us in a full state for longer.</p>
    <h3>Acne</h3>
    <p>It is common to experience improvements in your skin when switched to the ketogenic diet. Low-carb diets have been shown to calm inflammation, inflammation is what makes acne so red, sore, and tender.</p>
    <h3>Cholesterol & Blood Pressure</h3>
    <p>A keto diet has shown to improve triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels most associated with arterial buildup.
    More specifically low-carb, high-fat diets show a dramatic increase in HDL and decrease in LDL particle concentration compared to low-fat diets.
    Some blood pressure issues are associated with excess weight, which is a bonus since keto tends to lead to weight loss.</p>
    <h2>What to eat on Keto diet?</h2>
    <p>Like any other diet, you can't just eat whatever you want.
    The plus with the keto diet is that once you find yourself in <strong>ketosis</strong> your cravings for things you can't eat just disappear.
    It's important to understand that carbohydrates are not only in the junk foods that you love, but also some of the healthier foods that you enjoy.</p>
    <p>For example, on keto you need to avoid wheat (bread, pasta, cereals), starch (potatoes, beans, legumes) and fruit.</p>
