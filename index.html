    <h1>Welcome to Everything Keto</h1>
    <h2>What is the Keto diet?</h2>
    <p>The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet.
    This leads to the body producing ketones in the liver to be used as energy rather than glucose.
    Typically when you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose.
    When your body needs energy, it will convert glucose into energy.
    Your body will continue to use glucose as its primary energy source since it is so readily available.
    This leads to fat being stored rather than burned for energy.
    The keto diet lowers the intake of carbs, which puts the body into a state known as ketosis.
    Being on a keto diet makes it easier to access stored fat to burn it off.</p>
    <h2>What is ketosis?</h2>
    <p>Ketosis is when your body starts to break down fat instead of carbohydrates for your primary source of energy.
    When lowering the glucose available, the body will look for an alternative source of fuel(fat).
    When the body starts this process, it will start to produce ketones.
    Ketones are used as an alternative source of energy.</p>
    <h3>Steps to achieve Ketosis:</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Lower intake of carbohydrates.</strong> Everyone is different.
        When you start the keto diet, your carb limit may be higher while you're transitioning but remember this number can change over time.
        Most sites suggest the limit to be 35 grams of total carbs and 25 grams of net carbs.
        (Net carbs are calculated by subtracting the fiber grams from the total grams of carbs.)</li>
        <li><strong>Restrict protein intake.</strong> Protein should be limited when trying to reach ketosis.
        Excess protein is converted into glucose, leading to low levels of ketosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase fat intake.</strong> Eating more fat will keep you full longer.
        Fat is the main source of energy on keto.
        By consuming more fat, there will be less snack breaks becuase you will be satisifed.</li>
        <li><strong>Drink water.</strong> This may be obvious for any diet change but it is still important to stay hydrated.
        Drinking plenty of water will also help with controlling hunger as well.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>How to know you're in Ketosis?</h3>
    <p>There are different ways to see if you're in ketosis.
    You can measure your ketones level via urine strips but it can be expensive.
    Instead, you can monitor some changes that let you know you're on the right track.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased urination.</strong> Acetoacetate, a ketone body, will lead to increased bathroom visits.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Mouth.</strong> The increased urination will lead to increased thirst and dry mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Bad Breath.</strong> Acetone, a ketone body, excetes in our breath. It smells similar to nail polish remover and is temporary.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced hunger and increased energy.</strong> Increased fat intake leads to feeling satified longer.
        After getting over the "keto flu", many people expierence higher energy levels.</li>
      </ul>
