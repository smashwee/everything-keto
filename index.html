    <h1>Welcome to Everything Keto</h1>
    <h3>What is the Keto diet?</h3>
    <p>The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet.
    This leads to the body producing ketones in the liver to be used as energy rather than glucose.
    Typically when you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose.
    When your body needs energy, it will convert glucose into energy.
    Your body will continue to use glucose as its primary energy source since it is so readily available.
    This leads to fat being stored rather than burned for energy.
    The keto diet lowers the intake of carbs, which puts the body into a state known as ketosis.</p>
